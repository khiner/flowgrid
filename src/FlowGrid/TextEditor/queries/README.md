# Tree-sitter queries

This directory hold copies of select tree-sitter query files from [the corresponding nvim-treesitter directory](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/tree/master/queries).

I maintain the `tree-sitter-faust` queries in the [main parser repo](https://github.com/khiner/tree-sitter-faust) to conform to the nvim-treesitter highlight conventions, so I don't keep a redundant copy here and instead read the `.scm` files directly from the submodule.
(This query directory fallback applies to all languages.)
